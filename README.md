# CodeCompete

A very simple website for creating "games" such as Tic Tac Toe or Batlleship and "players" for those games.

"Matches" can then be created to match different players against each other to play a game.

Currently creating a match does nothing, but the plan is to execute the game and players and present the results.

The website is currently powered by asp.net core razor pages and entity framework core with sqlite.
